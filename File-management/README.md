# What File-Management Does
File-Management manages your files on MacOS to download from the web and organize seemlessly. It is currently in it's early development stages and is proof of concept. 

## Organize.py
  With the help of this script, you can sort your files on your desktop based on their file type. 
  Originally coded for MAC OS, but can be used on Windows and Linux as well with minor changes.
  Thanks to [Cursor AI](https://cursor.sh/) for help on this script.
